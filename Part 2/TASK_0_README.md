Task 0 - Working with a terrible language Using the proggramming language of your choice, let’s pretend the only available terms to use are:

Defining variables
For loops and using the range function
Addition

There are no other functions or any if statments and loops.

You can create the concept of “x - 1” with just the above! Here is how:

y = 0 
for i in range(1,x):
y += 1 
return y

Complete the code above so that any two numbers can be subtracted knowing that there is no concept of negitive.
Using a similar pattern implement multiplication and division.
